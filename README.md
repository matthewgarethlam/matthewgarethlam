### Welcome to my Github 👋
🌱 I'm a final year undergraduate at University College London studying Geography and Data Science. 

🗺 I specialise in geospatial data science. I love making maps and communicating with data.

⌨️ I'm an advanced user of R, I am proficient in Alteryx and Tableau and have basic fluency in Python and SQL.

🗃 Most projects on here are passion projects, but a selection are from my university courseworks.
